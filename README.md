# Voting and Random Check Simulation

This project is a simple voting simulation designed to demonstrate randomized vote processing while keeping individual votes private. Each ballot is entered individually, and the system simulates randomness in vote handling to reflect privacy in voting scenarios.

### Features
- Enter votes for multiple voters and submit them.
- Votes are processed and displayed in a results section.
- Simple, responsive UI built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
- Randomized processing demonstrates the concept of privacy in voting simulations.

This project originated as an idea for a *local democracy hackathon* in October 2024. The concept is functional in this version, but further development is encouraged to enhance its features.
